            <p>In January 2003, Starbucks began developing its pumpkin spice latte, following the success of winter beverages such as the peppermint mocha and eggnog latte.[7] During development, Starbucks' team collaborated with food scientists to create four potential seasonal beverages: a chocolate-based drink, a caramel-flavored beverage, a cinnamon-flavored option, and a pumpkin-flavored latte. Although the pumpkin beverage initially received mixed feedback, Dukes and the team advocated for its inclusion, ultimately approving it as the fourth option.</p>
